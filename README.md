# Prework Study Guide webpage

## Description

I created this application to serve as a resource for future Boot Camp students. It is intended as a reliable guide to the topics involved in the Prework course work. In creating this project, I had the opportunity to review my basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, and also to learn from the ground up to to manage my project workflow using Git.

You can access this page at [this location](https://sonjdaniel.github.io/Pre-Work-UofM-02-2023/ "Daniel's Pre-Work").

## Usage

There are two different ways to approach the use of this Prework Study Guide:

- You could use the bullet points within each section as a guide to what concepts you should expect to learn on that topic. Alternately, it could serve as a "to-do" list for the topic.
- If perhaps you are at a loss as to which section to study next, you could open the dev tools in your browser of choice, and view the console. Upon each refresh of the page, the included JavaScript will suggest a random selection from among the four subjects.

## Credits

I created all the code for this page, but it would not be possible without the instruction and guidance of the staff at the University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp, nor without the resources at W3 Schools and the Mozilla Developers' Network.
